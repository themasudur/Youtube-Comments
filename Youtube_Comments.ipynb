            "The future of Bangladesh is quite dark. We must understand that democracy, democratic rights, and the formation of a democratic system can not come overnight. It requires continuous mentoring of the people, it also requires ensuring that they all can participate, express and protest. Fortunately, against all odds, the people of India are fortunate enough that we were able to practice those, at least our constitution provides that right to practice them. That is the reason we can point out the discrimination, exploitation, oppression etc. This is because at least we know what is right and what is wrong. Unfortunately, that is not the case in Pakistan or Bangladesh. The biggest issue with them is that they are not secular countries, and if a country is not secular its democracy can't be stable. These student leaders are already separated into different ideologies and regional, religious as well as ethnic identities. They can not form a cohesive structure to reshape the nation. Till now they have one agenda and one opposition so that was the catalyst for their unity. Now in the changed circumstances, they will be controlled and ruled by others. We know who are they.\n",
